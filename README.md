# VPC_setup_in_EC2


Hey everyone! I recently tackled a fascinating project where I built a super secure space in the cloud called a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using Amazon Web Services (AWS). Let me walk you through how I did it::

**VPC Design and Configuration:** To start off, I crafted our very own custom area in the cloud with its own unique addresses. Picture it like designing your dream neighborhood. I made sure there were two types of zones: one where everyone could see, known as public subnets, and another more secluded area, called private subnets. Each zone had its own set of rules for who could come and go

**Network Security Implementation:** Safety was my top priority, so I set up special rules to manage who could enter and exit our cloud neighborhood. It's like having diligent security guards checking everyone at the entrance. Additionally, I ensured that our computer instances, like mini virtual computers in the cloud, only permitted access to the right people by configuring their own security measures.

**EC2 Instance Provisioning:** After the groundwork was laid, I introduced some virtual computers, or EC2 instances, and positioned them in various areas of our cloud neighborhood. To safeguard them, I equipped each one with a tailored set of rules dictating who they could communicate with and what tasks they could perform. Moreover, I granted each instance specific permissions to carry out its designated tasks effectively.

**Networking and Routing Mastery:** Just like ensuring all roads in a neighborhood lead to the right places, I established an internet gateway to facilitate communication for computers in the public zone with the outside world. For the private zone, I set up another special gate to enable outbound communication while keeping unwanted visitors at bay.

**SSH Key Pair and Access Control:** Similar to locking the doors of our homes, I ensured only authorized individuals could access our virtual computers. I created a special pair of keys, called an SSH key pair, to unlock the doors. Then, I set up rules to ensure only those with the keys could gain entry. Additionally, I implemented measures to regulate access to our AWS resources, ensuring only authorized personnel could utilize them.

**Testing and Validation:** Before wrapping up, I meticulously tested every aspect to ensure flawless operation. I verified that I could access our virtual computers using our special keys and confirmed their ability to communicate with each other. I double-checked all security protocols to prevent any unauthorized access attempts.

By embarking on this project, I not only honed my skills in AWS VPC setup but also gained invaluable hands-on experience in networking, security, and access control within the AWS ecosystem. This project serves as a testament to my dedication to creating robust, scalable, and secure cloud infrastructures.
